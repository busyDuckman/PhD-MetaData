# PhD-MetaData
A review of my thesis (Creemers, 2013) size and quality against time. Gathered from 79 available backups.  
  
I liked [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/7fdl2f/how_i_wrote_my_masters_thesis_oc/) on reddit, so I thought 
I would try  it myself. Pushed docx2txt output through "GNU style", then through a regex. Got some good meta-data.

TODO: graph it
